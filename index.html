          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <div class="half-width">
            <p>My name is Arletta Hayes and i'm the founder of LionessDesigns. I started this company as a way to get my artistic vision
              out into the biosphere, but also as a way to be able to stay home with my new son. I'm a belly dancing, herb-loving crunchy mama
              who also loves her some good code! I am looking forward to working on many different kinds of projects and am hoping to stretch
              myself and expand my horizons when it comes to my new career in the tech industry. As my slogan says, I try to RISE. AND. SLAY. EVERYDAY.</p>

            <img class="icon" src="img/sparkly-brain.png" width="200" height="200" alt="Sparkly Brainstorm"/>
            <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
            <p>I love coming up with ideas. Ideas make the world go round don't they? Or is that love.. We will take them both and call it good! But honestly,
            I love hearing different perspectives and ideas because it keep me from becoming stale in my headspace and keeps me sharp.</p>

          <div class="third-width">
            <img class="icon" src="img/paint-palette.png" width="200" height="200" alt="Paint Palette"/>
            <h4>Color Schemes</h4>
            <p>I was the four year old sitting on the floor with an entire box of 99 color crayola crayons just so I could re-arrange them from warm to cool..
              And color still holds the same fascination for me these days with the countless combinations possible and the feelings that can be evoked from
              them. Magical to say the least!</p>

            <img class="icon" src="img/star-brackets-coding.png" width="200" height="200" alt="Star Brackets"/>
            <h4>Clean Code</h4>
            <p>Html and CSS and I have a much newer love affair, but they have taken me to a new level of creativity and for that I am forever in their debt.
              The ability to have full control of the color and design of my site really appeals to my control issues, as well as creator complex.. I'm kidding
              obviously, but it is incredibly cool, isnt it?</p>

            <h4>LionessDesigns Logo</h4>
            <p>I designed this logo to be simple, and yet still be evocative of high grass behind which anything could be crouching ready to pounce.</p>

            <h4>LionessDesigns Business Card</h4>
            <p>With the design of my business card, I wanted to make sure that while still being straight-forward, the card would also demonstrate my
              color-scheme and a bit of personality as well.</p>

            <h4>LionessDesigns Website Draft</h4>
            <p>This site is the product of my very first attempt at creating an entire webpage from scratch, design/color scheme and all. I hope that it demonstrates
              my desire to create a vibe with a certain color scheme, and also that it brings my slogan to life.
